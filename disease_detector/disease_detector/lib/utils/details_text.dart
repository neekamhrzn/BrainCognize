    "A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the brain. The anatomy of the brain is very complex, with different parts responsible for different nervous system functions. Brain tumors can develop in any part of the brain or skull, including its protective lining, the underside of the brain (skull base), the brainstem, the sinuses and the nasal cavity, and many other areas. There are more than 120 different types of tumors that can develop in the brain, depending on what tissue they arise from.";

const String brainDangerous =
    "In the United States, brain and nervous system tumors affect about 30 adults out of 100,000. Brain tumors are dangerous because they can put pressure on healthy parts of the brain or spread into those areas. Some brain tumors can also be cancerous or become cancerous. They can cause problems if they block the flow of fluid around the brain, which can lead to an increase in pressure inside the skull. Some types of tumors can spread through the spinal fluid to distant areas of the brain or the spine.";

const String tumorSymptoms =
    "Different parts of the brain control different functions, so brain tumor symptoms will vary depending on the tumor’s location. For example, a brain tumor located in the cerebellum at the back of the head may cause trouble with movement, walking, balance and coordination. If the tumor affects the optic pathway, which is responsible for sight, vision changes may occur. \n\nThe tumor’s size and how fast it’s growing also affect which symptoms a person will experience. \n\nIn general, the most common symptoms of a brain tumor may include:";

    "•	Headaches \n•	Seizures or convulsions \n•	Difficulty thinking, speaking or finding words\n•	Personality or behavior changes\n•	Weakness, numbness or paralysis in one part or one side of the body\n•	Loss of balance, dizziness or unsteadiness\n•	Loss of hearing\n•	Vision changes\n•	Confusion and disorientation\n•	Memory loss";

const String tumorPreventiveList =
    "•	Healthy Diet\n•	Regular Exercise\n•	Maintain a Healthy Weight\n•	Avoid Exposure to Harmful Substances\n•	Protective Headgear\n•	Limit Radiation Exposure\n•	Quit Smoking and Limit Alcohol Consumption\n•	Regular Health Check-ups\n•	Genetic Counseling";

const String tumorPreventive =
    "While it's important to note that the exact causes of brain tumors are not always clear, and many factors are beyond our control, there are some general lifestyle choices and preventive measures that may contribute to overall brain health and potentially reduce the risk of brain tumors. Keep in mind that these measures are not guarantees, and it's always advisable to consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice. \n\nHere are some general preventive measures:";

const String tumorTreatment =
  "The treatment of a brain tumor depends on various factors, including the type, size, location, and grade of the tumor, as well as the overall health of the patient. \n\nTreatment strategies often involve a combination of approaches and may include the following:";

const String tumorResearch =
    "Research on brain tumors is a dynamic and ongoing field that encompasses a wide range of studies aimed at understanding the biology of brain tumors, improving diagnostic methods, developing new treatment modalities, and enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions.\n\nDoctors are working to learn more about brain tumors, ways to prevent them, how to best treat them, and how to provide the best care to people diagnosed with a brain tumor. The following areas of research may include new options for patients through clinical trials. Always talk with your doctor about the best diagnostic and treatment options for you. \n\nHere are some areas of research that have been explored:";

const String tumorResearchList =
    "•	Genetic and Molecular Studies:\nResearchers investigate the genetic and molecular characteristics of brain tumors to identify specific alterations that drive tumor growth. This includes studying mutations, gene expression patterns, and epigenetic changes.\n\n•	Biomarker Discovery:\nThe search for reliable biomarkers is ongoing to aid in the early detection and monitoring of brain tumors. Identifying specific molecules or genetic markers associated with brain tumors can improve diagnosis and treatment monitoring.\n\n•	Imaging Techniques:\nAdvances in imaging technologies, such as MRI and PET scans, continue to be a focus of research. Researchers aim to develop more precise and sensitive imaging methods to improve the visualization and characterization of brain tumors.\n\n•	Immunotherapy:\nImmunotherapy, which harnesses the body's immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells, is an active area of research for brain tumors. This includes the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors and personalized cancer vaccines.\n\n•	Targeted Therapies:\nTargeted therapies that specifically target the unique molecular features of cancer cells are being explored. This includes drugs that interfere with specific signaling pathways involved in tumor growth and survival.\n\n";
